## BIO 508 - Evolution and Biodiversity

This is an undergraduate and graduate course at the University of Kentucky. The goal of this course is to introduce students to the field of phylogenetic comparative methods and develop basic skills 

By the end of the semester, students will be able to:

1. Understand how phylogenetic trees are built.
2. Develop basic computer skills to manipulate phylogenetic trees and traits.
3. Become familiar with the primary literature of comparative methods.
4. Develop quantitative reasoning to follow methods and results in scientific articles.
5. Infer correlations between traits using a phylogenetic tree as part of the modeling approach.
6. Model traits on a phylogeny and perform ancestral state estimation.

## Assignments

### Participation and Reading Quiz

There are many readings in this course. I will quiz you on concepts and ideas from the articles after I have introduced the basics during the lecture. Some of the readings are challenging, but they wonâ€™t be long. Make sure you are taking your time to understand them. I am happy to discuss any of these readings one-on-one. Another way to compensate for missing points in the reading quizzes is by participating and asking questions during the class. Participation is optional, but highly encouraged.


As a reminder, every student in the class is new to this topic regardless from their current degree or background. My goal is to introduce you to a completely new (and exciting!) field.

### Midterm- 1 Modeling plan plus descriptive statistics (max 3 pages)

Your midterm is very simple. For undergraduate students, I will provide you with some trees and traits to plot some phylogenetic summary statistics, and describe what kind of analysis you would want to do as your final project. For graduate students, I will ask you to find your own tree and traits, describe your plan for final project, and also create some summary statistics for your data. Altogether, this midterm should be no longer than 3 pages and should cite specific references that will be essential for your final project.

### Final report (max 7 pages)

Your final report will be a complete phylogenetic comparative analysis. You will start by introducing the problem, describing your tree and traits. Later, you will be describing a comparative method to solve the problem. Finally, you will discuss the importance of your results and what you have learned about comparative methods. I will be providing clear guidance and a rubric about the sections required for your final. I have allocated time during the semester to work together on this final project, hoping that you feel supported and guided through the whole process.
